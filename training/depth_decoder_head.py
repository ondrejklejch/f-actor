    """
    Alternative to the flat multi-head `dsu_head`: predicts the semantic (first)
    Mimi codebook with a small trainable linear head, then predicts the remaining
    acoustic codebooks with Sesame CSM's pretrained depth decoder, which is kept
    entirely frozen. A trainable adapter projects our backbone's hidden state into
    the depth decoder's expected input space, since our backbone was never jointly
    trained with it.

    This module only ever predicts a single speaker's `num_dsus` codebooks - it is
    only meant to be used for the first speaker's stream (see
    `DSUModel.calc_loss_on_c1_only` requirement in modeling_dsu.py), not this
    repo's dual-speaker "talk to itself" setup.

    Confirmed I/O contract from `transformers`' `CsmDepthDecoderModel.forward`
    (`codebook_idxs = clamp(position_ids - 1, min=0)`, `offset = codebook_idxs *
    vocab_size`, `inputs_embeds = embed_tokens(input_ids + offset)`, then
    `inputs_embeds[:, 0] = backbone_last_hidden_state`): position 0 is a
    throwaway placeholder (its embedding is immediately overwritten by the
    backbone hidden state); position k (k>=1) must hold codebook (k-1)'s REAL id,
    embedded via codebook (k-1)'s own embedding sub-table, and predicts codebook
    k's logits (via `codebooks_head`). So to predict codebooks 1..num_dsus-1 (a
    length num_dsus-1 sequence), position 1 holds the semantic/codebook-0 id,
    position 2 holds codebook-1's id, etc. - the semantic id IS fed into the
    depth decoder (just not as an output target, since our own semantic_head
    predicts it separately).

            If False, its params stay requires_grad=True for the whole run
            instead - deliberately NOT toggled later. DeepSpeed ZeRO stage 1/2
            flattens every optimizer param group's parameters into one fixed
            contiguous buffer at initialization, and requires that group's set

        One incremental depth-decoder call: exactly one new token in (plus the
        running KV cache), exactly one logits row out. Lets the frozen
        `depth_decoder` do its own embedding lookup (`input_ids=`) - unsafe
        under the training-time gradient-checkpointing/DeepSpeed combination
        for the in-place position-0 write (see `_build_inputs_embeds`
        docstring), but that write never happens here (no
        `backbone_last_hidden_state` passed - see `_seed`), and generation runs
        under `@torch.no_grad()` regardless, so there is no autograd graph to
        break.

        Absolute position (and thus which codebook's embedding sub-table /
        output head to use) is derived by the model itself from
        `past_key_values`'s current length, so callers just need to call this
        once per position in order - no manual offset bookkeeping needed.

        `logits_to_keep=1` (rather than the model's default of `0`) is required
        here: the default assumes a single full-sequence call and drops local
        position 0 unconditionally (right for that case, since 0 is always the
        placeholder there) - but every one of these calls has exactly one
        *real* position at local index 0, which would otherwise be silently
        dropped.

        attention_mask: [B, L_so_far] of ones covering every cached position
        including this call's new one (the caller extends it by one column
        before passing it in).

        Passing `cache_position=None` (the model's own default) is NOT safe
        here: `CsmDepthDecoderForCausalLM.forward` forwards `cache_position`
        straight into `CsmCodebooksHead.forward`, which uses it to pick this
        frame's per-codebook output weight (`self.weight[cache_position - 1]`).
        When `cache_position is None`, that head instead falls back to
        `self.weight[arange(hidden_states.shape[1])]` - i.e. it assumes the
        hidden states it was just given start at codebook 0 and are
        sequential. That fallback is only correct for a full growing-sequence
        call (this class's old, non-cached `_generate_acoustic_ids`); for a
        length-1 incremental call it always resolves to codebook 0's weight
        regardless of the real position, so every step after the first
        silently reused codebook 0's output head and produced wrong
        (degenerate/repeating) ids. We must pass the true absolute
        `cache_position` explicitly so the correct codebook head is selected.
