class CsmDepthDecoderHead(nn.Module):
    """
    Alternative to the flat multi-head `dsu_head`: predicts the semantic (first)
    Mimi codebook with a small trainable linear head, then predicts the remaining
    acoustic codebooks with Sesame CSM's pretrained depth decoder, which is kept
    entirely frozen. A trainable adapter projects our backbone's hidden state into
    the depth decoder's expected input space, since our backbone was never jointly
    trained with it.

    This module only ever predicts a single speaker's `num_dsus` codebooks - it is
    only meant to be used for the first speaker's stream (see
    `DSUModel.calc_loss_on_c1_only` requirement in modeling_dsu.py), not this
    repo's dual-speaker "talk to itself" setup.

    Confirmed I/O contract from `transformers`' `CsmDepthDecoderModel.forward`
    (`codebook_idxs = clamp(position_ids - 1, min=0)`, `offset = codebook_idxs *
    vocab_size`, `inputs_embeds = embed_tokens(input_ids + offset)`, then
    `inputs_embeds[:, 0] = backbone_last_hidden_state`): position 0 is a
    throwaway placeholder (its embedding is immediately overwritten by the
    backbone hidden state); position k (k>=1) must hold codebook (k-1)'s REAL id,
    embedded via codebook (k-1)'s own embedding sub-table, and predicts codebook
    k's logits (via `codebooks_head`). So to predict codebooks 1..num_dsus-1 (a
    length num_dsus-1 sequence), position 1 holds the semantic/codebook-0 id,
    position 2 holds codebook-1's id, etc. - the semantic id IS fed into the
    depth decoder (just not as an output target, since our own semantic_head
    predicts it separately).
